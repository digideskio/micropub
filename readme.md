# Backchannel

Backchannel is based on @myf's [Patchterm](https://github.com/myf/patchterm).

The goal of Backchannel is to view a "micro" message type.

A few implementable goals

- [x] View micro messages
- [] View micro messages in realtime
- [] Limit micro messages to 140 or so characters
- [] Render user handles
